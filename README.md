PROBLEM O1 

The Wavelength Calculator 

the program will print the wavelength of visible light in a double slit diffraction experiment, where the values of m, theta and d will be given as input, the output will be a)the numeric value of wavelength , b)the color of light

PROBLEM 02 

If a diffraction grating produce a third order bright spot for green light (of wavelegnth 530nm ) of 65.0 degree from the central maximum, at what angel will be the second order bright spot be for red light.(of wavelenght 700nm)
